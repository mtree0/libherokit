#libherokit#

##Overview##
If you've ever tried making a mobile substrate tweak for iOS, you know just how tedious it can be looking up, finding, and testing SpringBoard related code. In the process of developing my various tweaks and tools, I have thrown together a small library of common SpringBoard & application methods. After some organizing, compatibility checking, and overall fine tuning, I give you libherokit â€” an iOS 5+ convenience library that aims to make your life easier.

##Setup##
Getting libherokit ready for use is beyond easy. Simply make sure you have libherokit installed on your iDevice, (add "com.mitchtreece.libherokit" to your control file's depends: line if you plan on deploying to other devices), add "-lherokit" to your projects XXX_LDFLAGS (You will also need to copy libherokit.dylib into your lib path. I have included the library in the root of the project). Finally, import "libherokit.h" into your project and bam! you're  ready to go!

##Usage##
###Activate application###
Launch an SBApplication either by passing an SBApplication, or it's display identifier.

    [[HKHeroController sharedHeroController] activateApplication:app];
    [[HKHeroController sharedHeroController] activateApplicationWithDisplayIdentifier:@"com.yourcompany.appname"];

###Key application###
Returns the current key (open) SBApplication either as an SBApplication, or as it's display identifier. If there is no key application, SpringBoard or it's respective display identifier will be returned.

    [[HKHeroController sharedHeroController] keyApplication];
    [[HKHeroController sharedHeroController] keyApplicationDisplayID];

You can close (not kill) key applications by calling:

    [[HKHeroController sharedHeroController] deactivateKeyApplication];

If you need to quickly ascertain if SpringBoard is visible (or if there is a keyApplication or not) you can call:

    [[HKHeroController sharedHeroController] isSpringBoardKey];

This returns a BOOL indicating whether SpringBoard is the key (visible) application (i.e. no apps open).

###Kill application###
Kills a specified SBApplication either by passing an SBApplication, or by it's display identifier.

    [[HKHeroController sharedHeroController] killApplication:app];
    [[HKHeroController sharedHeroController] killApplicationWithDisplayID:@"com.yourcompany.appname"];

By default, the above methods also remove the application icon from the multitasking switcher. You can override this behavior by calling:

    [[HKHeroController sharedHeroController] killApplication:app removeFromSwitcher:NO];

###Image Utilities###
Returns a UIImage of the current screen.

    [[HKHeroController sharedHeroController] currentScreenImage];

Returns a UIImage of the specified application's icon. HKIconSizeSettings = 1, HKIconSizeSpringBoard = 2

    [[HKHeroController sharedHeroController] iconForApplicationWithDisplayID:@"com.yourcompany.appname" size:HKIconSizeSpringBoard];

###Device utilities###
The following methods execute various device-related tasks. They can all be called like this:

    [[HKHeroController sharedHeroController] methodNameGoesHere];

They are all pretty self-explanatory so I will just list them, not go into detail about them.

>- (void)shutdownDevice
- (void)rebootDevice
- (void)respringDevice
- (void)enterSafeMode
- (void)lockDevice
- (void)vibrateDevice
- (void)setBrightnessLevel:(float)level
- (void)openSpotlight
- (void)toggleSwitcher
- (void)toggleSiri
- (void)toggleNotificationCenter
- (void)toggleTorch

###Display stacks (iOS 5 only)###
These methods return the respective SBDisplayStack. (Note: iOS 6 did away with these, so don't try to use them if you're running iOS 6+)

    [[HKHeroController sharedHeroController] preActivateDisplayStack];
    [[HKHeroController sharedHeroController] activeDisplayStack];
    [[HKHeroController sharedHeroController] suspendingDisplayStack];
    [[HKHeroController sharedHeroController] suspendedEventOnlyDisplayStack];

##Future updates##
I plan on adding more functionality to this library as I need & use it myself. :)
